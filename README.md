# MobsSimulator-Python

This is a tool that use Randomness (or Monte Carlo methods) and the theory of Collective Action to study the Mob phenomenon. This simple tool uses the four possible scenarios (mentioned in [this publication](https://cdn.aaai.org/ocs/10239/10239-45278-1-PB.pdf) ) a mob practitioner could face to predict the success or failur of a Mob and to estimate the number of powerful actors (or organizers) needed to have a successful Mob.
